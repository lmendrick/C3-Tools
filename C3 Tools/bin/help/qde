Quick DTA Editor: A Quick How-To

This tool is designed to expedite modifying the metadata for song files
Often-time people ask 'how do I change x in the song?'
Well, you can use this tool!
Drag-and-drop or use the 'Open file' option to find your song file
You can edit single songs or packs, but only songs.dta files, upgrades.dta files will not be opened by this tool

What can you change?
Everything that is controlled by the songs.dta file, which is all the metadata for the song

The file is written in plain English so it's very easy to understand, but if you have questions, please feel free to post in our forums and someone will be happy to help you

Just in case, our forums can be found at: http://forums.customscreators.com

Once you've made all the changes to the DTA file, just exit out, and click 'Yes' to save changes
This program will detect that you closed the file and will automatically replace the DTA file in the song package with the new one you just modified

The program will then repack the file as an unlocked, signed CON file regardless of whether the input was CON or LIVE, so it will be ready to go in your Xbox

A backup file is created in the same directory as the input file with '_backup' added to the name
If any step goes wrong, the backup will be restored and you will not lose any data

I hope this makes modifying songs even easier than before

Enjoy
