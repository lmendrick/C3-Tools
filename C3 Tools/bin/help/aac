Advanced Art Converter: How To Use

All Rock Band formats are now supported: *.png_xbox, *.png_ps3 and *.png_wii, as well as the intermediary *.dds and *.tpl formats
Many, but not all, MILO files (*.milo_xbox and *.milo_ps3) are supported thanks to the hard work by PikminGuts92

Start by selecting the folder where the input images or MILO files are
You can also just drag and drop any file from that folder to the program

The program will automatically detect existing images or Rock Band files and decide which functions to enable

Allowed input formats: *.bmp | *.png | *.jpg | *.gif | *.tif | *.tga | *.png_xbox | *.png_ps3 | *.png_wii | *.dds | *.tpl | *.milo_xbox | *.milo_ps3

Any size input image is allowed, program will automatically resize when converting to Rock Band format
Default texture size when converting to *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3 is 512x512. You can change this by going to Advanced -> Texture size
When converting to *.png_wii the texture size is 256x256 and, due to the Wii's limitations, can't be changed

Available output formats: *.bmp | *.png | *.jpg. You can choose any combination of these formats
You can also output *.dds files (X360/PS3) and .tpl files (Wii) by going to Advanced -> Don't delete .dds / .tpl files

You can also convert directly from *.png_xbox to *.png_ps3 and vice-versa, and from *.png_xbox / *.png_ps3 to *.png_wii

Besides Rock Band album art, most game textures from the following HMX games can be converted from *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3:
Rock Band 1
Rock Band 2
Rock Band 3
Rock Band: Blitz
Lego Rock Band
Green Day: Rock Band
The Beatles: Rock Band
AC/DC LIVE Track Pack
Rock Band Track Pack 2
Rock Band Metal Track Pack
Rock Band Music Store
Dance Central
Dance Central 2
Dance Central 3

If you have a *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3 image that Advanced Art Converter can't convert, you may be able to help it understand the file and convert it
See the _README.txt file in /bin/headers/ for more information
