Visualizer: How To Use

You can create an image in one of two ways:

1) Manual:
Type in all the information, click on the appropriate icons, drag-and-drop the album art to the box on the left (most formats are allowed, including the more exotic .dds and .png_xbox)
Hover over almost anything in Visualizer to get a tip on how to use it

2) Automatic:
Click on 'Load Song' and select a CON or LIVE file
You can also just drag and drop a CON or LIVE file on this form
Visualizer will try to load everything it can from the file supplied, but you may need to fill in some fields (mostly for RB1 era files)

The small rectangle on the bottom left is for you to drag / drop your user logo if you wish to use one
This will be overlaid on top of the album art, and can be moved around by clicking on it

Visualizer now includes several pre-made Holiday Themes!
These will be automatically enabled by Visualizer based on the time of year, all you got to do is click on the Holiday Button to enable / disable the theme

To use the Holiday Theme at different times of year, click on the plus icon and select one of the available themes

You can also create your own themes!
You need two files, one called 'theme_overlay.png' and one called 'theme_button.png' - use the included themes as reference
Your files must match the dimensions of the included themes and be .png (with transparency)
Replace 'theme' with the name of your holiday or whatever you want
Place those two in the /res folder - that's it! Visualizer will show those themes next time you click on the plus icon

C3 Authors must make sure to get admin approval if they're planning to use any custom designs

You can choose between Myriad Pro (default), Calibri, Tahoma and Times New Roman fonts

To use a custom font, create a text file named font.txt and place it in the /res folder. Enter one line of text that says FontName=Name Here and save it Visualizer will load that and make it the default font, but you can still choose any of the other fonts mentioned above. 
Make sure the font name is spelled correctly (case sensitive) and is actually installed on your system.

VISUALIZER WILL ONLY WORK WITH SINGLE SONGS, NO PACKS, NO PRO UPGRADES
