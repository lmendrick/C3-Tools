Video Preparer: How To Use

First, put all of your files in one folder, default is 'videoprep_input' in the same directory as this program
Click on 'Select Input Folder' if your files are in a different folder,
or you can drag and drop one of the files into anywhere in this form

Input files can be
1) individual songs
2) existing song packs or exports

Title for the pack is automatically entered but you can change it at will

Check the desired options ... defaults are strongly recommended, options are self-explanatory

Press 'Begin' and choose a location and file name for your pack
As long as the progress bar is animated, the program is working hard for you.
Be patient, it might take a while.

Enjoy
