FEATURES / CHANGE LOG:

v4.7.0 - 50K Edition

MOGG MAKER (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to drag/drop .mp3/.ogg/.wav/.opus/.aiff/.flac/.m4a audio files to create a Mogg file for use with Rock Band games

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to Visualize the new Clone Hero SNG files
- Added ability to Visualize Clone Hero songs in loose folder structure, including .opus and .ogg audio formats
- Added ability to Visualize Rocksmith 2014 PSARC files *** please note that the difficulty bubbles are an educated guess based on some file metadata, there is no clearly defined difficulty levels in Rocksmith
- Improved ability to Visualize YARG songs in extracted CON folder structure, now plays both *.yarg_mogg and *.mogg audio formats
- Fixed bug where Visualizer would fail to display DDS files
- Fixed bug that wasn't showing the chart author unless it was Visualizing an Xbox 360 CON file

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Added tool to batch decode folder of new Clone Hero SNG files
- Added option to convert SNG .opus audio files to .ogg format during decoding

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer a/k/a The Linos Special tool - click on it for a description of what it does
- Fixed bug where it would fail when converting from PS3 folder to CON if the PS3 folder had the word "ps3" in the file path

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Added ability to batch replace the vocal_gender value
- Added ability to specify "fallback" game_origin value for advanced users
- Added ability to enable/disable recursive searching
- Minor bug fixes to logic that may have resulted in inconsistent behavior

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added option (under Advanced) to select signing the resulting pack as CON or LIVE

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where it would list 22500Hz as a rate option instead of 22050Hz

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where intermediary DDS files created when converting from Xbox/PS3 format would not have their mipmaps due to incorrect DDS header

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Fixed bug where it would throw an error upon loading the previously used folder

PACK CREATOR
- Fixed a few graphical bugs

----------

v4.6.6

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed broken importing of YARG or Clone Hero JSON files due to an unknown bug in Path.GetFileName, using workaround that should work - reminder that valid file names are "yarg.json" "ch.json" or "clonehero.json"
- Fixed compatibility that would break importing of YARG or Clone Hero JSON files for certain songs that had more than just the year in the year field (i.e. Beatles "Year": "1967 (November 24)")

----------

v4.6.5

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to Visualize PS3 PKG files

FILE ANALYZER
- Added ability to analyze PS3 PKG files

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Added ability to view and analyze mogg files in PS3 PKG files

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added ability to process PKG packs into single CONs (before would only work with single PKGs)
- Fixed bug that would "patch" mogg files that would not need it

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Added ability to batch replace the author name in the DTA files with any value the user enters
- Changed behavior to search recursively for CON files in nested folder structure

BATCH CRYPTOR
- Fixed bug that would apply PS3 patch to files that would not need it, leading to corrupt mogg files

----------

v4.6.4

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Fixed small bug related to how the game_origin value was being written to the DTA file

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed bug where importing songs from 2020+ would be read as 0 or blank - unfortunately you'll need to re-import your affected songs since the data was never saved to the setlist the first time around

PACK CREATOR
- Added RB1/RB2/RB3 buttons at top to quickly change game ID without having to navigate through the Advanced menu
- Fixed graphic bug that was cutting off the right margin

CON CREATOR
- Fixed bug that would not allow you to add files to selected folder and instead would add them to the Root folder - this is particularly useful if packaging a bunch of pro upgrades for example: manually add the songs_upgrades folder (right click on the left panel and add folder), make sure that folder is clicked, and drag and drop all your upgrades on the right side - done!

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Fixed bug introduced in v4.6.0 where the quality setting was being ignored

----------

v4.6.3

FILE ANALYZER
- Now scans for PS/CH/YARG Expert+ 2x Bass Pedal notes during file analysis
- Fixed small bug where individual MIDI files would not be processed, only CON files would
- Fixed bug where toms would not be counted correctly

----------

v4.6.2

GENERAL
- Every instance of a folder browsing dialog has now been replaced with a much more modern version thanks to Onyxite pointing out the FolderPicker class by Simon Mourier - it should be a one-to-one seamless replacement so I don't anticipate issues but if you experience any problems please let me know

FILE ANALYZER
- Fixed bugs introduced when added batch processing so now it should accept a file as an argument so you can launch it by drag/dropping a file over the File Analyzer button - this also fixes other related bugs

----------

v4.6.1

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where sometimes crowd and backing tracks would end up blank after downmixing

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where sometimes crowd and backing tracks would end up blank after downmixing

----------

v4.6.0

NOTE: C3 TOOLS HAS MIGRATED FROM NET FRAMEWORK 4.0 TO 4.8.1. ALSO ALL AUDIO PROCESSING AND ENCODING DEPENDENCIES WERE UPDATED TO MOST RECENT (BASS, BASS.NET, BASS ADD-ONS, NO LONGER RELYING ON OGGENC2). NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE FOR YOU BUT IF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WEIRD OR BROKEN PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP.

RB3 CHARACTER EDITOR
- Almost entire rewrite of the code - the original code made incorrect assumptions about character genders and changing genders in the Editor would lead to weird behavior in game or crashing. REMOVED ability to change gender and rewrote how most of the Editor works to now better edit, save, import and export characters with less problems in game. You just need to make sure the character you're editing matches the gender of the clothes and accessories you're assigning to it (they're now labeled (F) and (M)). Likewise only import prefab characters into a character of the same gender to avoid issues.
- Added support for PS3 save.dat files (only unencrypted files from RPCS3, sorry) 
- Can now export your custom character to a .prefab file, and can then import that .prefab file into another save file - the import/export can be done from Xbox 360 band3 <-> PS3 save.dat
- Fixed bug where offset for character 8 was wrong so it would never load
- Added some color to the program since it was so bland

WII CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)
- Added ability to select sample rate for preview audio
- Changed behavior so preview audio won't have crowd track present
- Changed behavior so it will always downmix drums if more than 2 drum channels regardless of total channels in the mogg
- Slight improvement to start time of auto created preview mogg
- Fixed bug / compatibility issue when downmixing certain songs that had mono tracks
- Fixed bug caused by oggenc2 when downmixing songs with 8 or less channels - no longer relying on oggenc2

PS3 CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)
- Fixed bug / compatibility issue when downmixing certain songs that had mono tracks
- Fixed bug caused by oggenc2 when downmixing songs with 8 or less channels - no longer relying on oggenc2

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)

DTA PARSER
- Added/fixed compatibility with songs that have long and short versions within the same CON file - now it reads the long version (sorry not going to add support for choosing which version it reads, so we're defaulting to long version) and this means Visualizer plays the correct audio, the Converters use the right audio and MIDI file, etc

FLAPPY C3
- Performance improvements

GENERAL
- Fixed (apparently?) longstanding bug with audio processing code that may have been applying wrong vols and pans for songs with 8 or less channels

----------

v4.5.0

RB3 CHARACTER EDITOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- Thanks to Lord Zedd\TehBanStick's generosity, as well as requests I received, RB3 Character Editor (formerly known simply as RB3Tool) joins C3 Tools
- (In theory) now you can resign the save game file from within the program -> Click on the Exit button then select Yes when prompted - please notify me if this doesn't work as intended
- Drag/drop is now enabled - just drag your band3 file to the main form and it'll auto-load
- Many cosmetic changes implemented (all buttons have hand cursors, the form is centered on screen, added Exit button, all message boxes were reworked to be more informational and look better, etc)
- Under the hood changes that were necessary since the Xceed WPF library that was used previously was no longer viable so I had to compile my own from Github

BATCH CRYPTOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- This tool allows you to batch encrypt loose moggs and moggs within CONs - resulting moggs are PS3 friendly and ready to be used without additional patching or re-encrypting like before

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added menu option to patch an individual mogg file for PS3 use - click on Tools -> Patch mogg for PS3 use and then select the mogg to be patched
- Improved behavior so now it can distinguish between batch folders of C3 PS3 files with their static klic and RPCS3 folders of extracted Onyx PKG files with their dynamic klic and will work with both (plus still works with PKG files)
- Fixed bug when downmixing and reencoding to quality 3 where it would mess up the instrument ranks/difficulties if an instrument was missing from the tracks section - thanks to Linos for pointing it out and troubleshooting
- Fixed bug where it would fail to convert if the file path had ps3 in the name - thanks to GeeForce11 for pointing it out and always helping troubleshoot
- Improved behavior and stability when patching moggs for PS3 use (mostly under the hood work that you won't notice)

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to recursively search for all songs.dta files and load them into your .setlist file - this is mainly useful for RPCS3 users but i'm sure others might find a use for it too

FILE INDEXER
- Added option to export displayed songs to Json format (right click on the window)

----------

v4.4.1

GENERAL
- Improvements to mogg encryption that should now allow encrypted Xbox 360 moggs to work directly on PS3 without needing any additional decryption/encryption. Pair this with Onyx's Quick Convert for a better Xbox 360 to PS3 experience - infinite thanks to LocalH for his assistance with this

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added support for importing YARG songs export .json files. To do this open YARG, go to Settings, in the General tab click on Export Songs List (For Ouvert Bot), choose a folder and click Save for the songs.json file to be exported. IMPORTANT: rename it to yarg.json since both YARG and Clone Hero export songs.json files. Drag and drop that yarg.json file to Setlist Manager and it'll do the rest for you. For now this is limited because YARG only exports so much data compared to RB3. Feel free to request additional data be added to the .json export and I'll add support
- Added support for importing Clone Hero songs export .json files. To do this open Clone Hero, log into a profile, go to Settings, in the General tab go down to and click on Export Song List (Json). It will look like nothing happened but you're good. Exit Clone Hero and go to My Documents\Clone Hero. You should find a songs.json file there. IMPORTANT: rename it to ch.json since both YARG and Clone Hero export songs.json files. Drag and drop that ch.json file to Setlist Manager and it'll do the rest for you. For now this is limited because Clone Hero only exports so much data compared to RB3. Feel free to request additional data be added to the .json export and I'll add support

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added feature to go from PS3 folder structure (one or multiple) to Xbox 360 CON in one click -> click on PS3 to CON then Batch convert PS3 song folder(s) to CON. Select the folder where you have your PS3 folder or folders you want to convert to CON and let it do the rest
- Added feature to go from Onyx PS3 PKG files (one or multiple) to Xbox 360 CON in one click -> click on PS3 to CON then Batch convert PS3 PKG to CON. Select the folder where you have your PKG file(s) and let it go to work - you can also drag/drop one or multiple PKG files to PS3 Converter and it'll automatically convert the file(s) to CON

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER (now YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER)
- Minor changes to behavior to better fit use in 2023

----------

v4.4.0

WII CONVERTER
- Added option (find it under Options menu) to automatically downmix drum tracks with more than two channels to a stereo drum track during the conversion process. If you enable this option, you also have the option (enabled by default) to delete the crowd track if present in the mogg file. The resulting file is encoded in quality 3 as requested by many to have a lower bitrate that should reduce file size and reduce stuttering in game. The resulting ogg file has a proper mogg header added thanks to maxton's makemogg tool. The songs.dta file is also edited during this process to reflect the changes made to the audio file. The MIDI file is also edited during this process to reflect the correct drum mixes for a stereo drum track. In theory, this should eliminate all the stuttering issues that Wii players were experiencing - many thanks to r0bd0g for his assistance with this
- Changed behavior when creating preview audio file to properly add a mogg header using maxton's makemogg tool rather than using the faked mogg header we've been using all these years

PS3 CONVERTER
- This tool is now officially deprecated in favor of Onyx Tool Suite since that tool can do a significantly better job at creating PS3 customs. However...
- Added tool (find it under the Tools menu on the left) to automatically downmix drum tracks to stereo to avoid going over the problematic 16 channel limit. This process will also encode the audio at quality 3 which should eliminate stuttering in game. This process will also encrypt the mogg file as required by the PS3. The songs.dta file is also edited during this process to reflect the changes made to the audio file. The MIDI file is also edited during this process to reflect the correct drum mixes for a stereo drum track. Use it by selecting the folder where your CON files are, it'll do the work and leave you with modified CONs that you feed to Onyx's Quick Convert feature. For safety, each modified CON will have a _backup copy made - many thanks to Linos for his assistance with this

FILE ANALYZER
- Fixed bug where some C3 encrypted and obfuscated mogg files could not be analyzed

----------

v4.3.2b

Hotfix to address two minor issues with VIDEO PREPARER and one minor issue with PACK CREATOR. You probably don't need to get this update.

----------

v4.3.2

CON CREATOR
- Added support for creating Dance Central, Dance Central 2, and Dance Central 3 files - this is EXPERIMENTAL as I have no way to test - let me know what works and what doesn't
- Fixed bug that would not allow user to create a pack because all files that should go to each song's gen folder would go to the first song's gen folder

RBtoUSB
- Now includes clean copy of Title Update 5 (TU5) and can be copied with one click in the menu. This is useful for anyone with a modified console who wants to play RB3 Enhanced (RB3E). NOT NEEDED if you play RB3DX or both RB3DX and RB3E combined.

PACK CREATOR
- Now has option to search recursively in a folder structure rather than you having to have all the songs on the same level (enabled by default)

VIDEO PREPARER
- Now has option to search recursively in a folder structure rather than you having to have all the songs on the same level (enabled by default)
- Fixed bug that would mess up some DTAs resulting in a missing closing bracket and all hell breaking loose
- Changed some default behaviors to better accomodate usage of this Tool in 2023 (I'm looking at you Fat Halpert)

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where you couldn't increase audio quality unless you first clicked down to lower audio quality

----------

v4.3.1

VISUALIZER
- Added support for YARG song files - just drag and drop the song folder onto Visualizer and it'll work like if it was a CON file

FILE ANALYZER
- Added support for yarg_mogg files

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Added support for yarg_mogg files

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Fixed minor bug that would result in genre line being added twice

DTA PARSER
- Fixed small bug where sometimes there would be an error processing the keys audio tracks

----------

v4.3.0

MILOMOD (NEW FEATURE!)
- StackOverflow0x's tool to convert RBN2 MIDI venues to Milo venues joins C3 Tools - going forward it will be shipped with C3 Tools but can still be updated separately if Stack issues an update before I do - for any questions on functionality or support please hit up StackOverflow0x or let me know and I'll pass it along

RB3 SAVE SCORES VIEWER (NEW FEATURE!)
- StackOverflow0x's tool to view and edit scores in Rock Band 3 save files for Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii joins C3 Tools - going forward it will be shipped with C3 Tools but can still be updated separately if Stack issues an update before I do - for any questions on functionality or support please hit up StackOverflow0x or let me know and I'll pass it along

FLAPPY C3 (NEW FEATURE!)
- Ported over my old Flappy C3 "game" right into the main C3 Tools form - just click on the icon on the bottom left and then click click click like the original game. This "game" is fully customizable - see the \res\flappy\ folder for the three themes that are included and for an idea on how to make your own

SAVE FILE IMAGE EXTRACTOR (NOW SAVE FILE IMAGE EDITOR)
- I think I finally fixed the bug with saving changes to the Xbox 360 band3 file - you should now be able to edit and save without problems
- Fixed bug where when exporting composite character image, the buttons would be visible on the resulting image

FILE ANALYZER
- Can now batch analyze CON, MIDI, MOGG, PNG_XBOX and PNG_PS3 files - just drag and drop multiple files to the form instead of one by one like before

CON EXPLORER
- Reworked design and code so now it should correctly detect CON/LIVE/INSTALLER(TU)/OTHER file type and will save changes to the correct file type instead of defaulting to CON when it didn't recognize the file type (i.e. with TU files) - as a result you can no longer convert from CON to LIVE or LIVE to CON from within this tool - use CON/RBA Converter tool for that
- Can now easily extract or replace the .milo_xbox file without having to navigate through the contents structure of the CON file
- Added option to Inject file along with existing option to Replace file - if when using Replace you get a corrupted file (like with TU files), try using Inject and it may give you a different result

----------

v4.2.0

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to batch process CON files to edit their DTA files. For now the two features added as requested were the option to batch replace the game_origin value with a custom value (user enters it) and the option to move the Song Author value that Magma: C3 embeds in the DTA file but is not accessible from within the game into the DTA array proper. This will allow mods like RB3 Deluxe to read and display the Song Author in game, plus i'm sure other cool features can be developed with this.
- Also allows you to batch separate bundled DTA files into their component DTA files using the menu button for that feature

RBA EDITOR (beta) (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to extract the contents of RBA/RBS files, replace them with modified versions, and recompile the RBA/RBS file - feel free to play around with drag/dropping into each button and right clicking on the buttons to see what you can do with each component file
- This is in Beta stage because I have no way to test the resulting RBA/RBS files - in theory they work but I need feedback from people with access to Audition Mode or another way to play with these files

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added feature to extract a single song from a pack - simply select the song in the list and click "Extract selected"

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Now supports saving to DXT1 format for reduced file size - find the option in Advanced -> Texture Type. Still defaults to DXT5 for better image quality but if you're trying to optimize file sizes, DXT1 should be your choice.

VOLUME NORMALIZER
- Now parses some atypical CON volume levels correctly, and cleans up folders after failures
- Thanks to SuperRiderTH for continuing to maintain this tool, which he created and graciously "donated" to be part of C3 Tools

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added option to export unique songs when merging a .setlist file with an existing .setlist file - just follow the prompts and you end up with a text file with the unique songs listed so you can figure out why they're missing from your setlist (first load the smaller .setlist then load the larger .setlist, won't work the other way)
- Fixed nasty bug where if you had an open .setlist file and tried to import a cache/vff file, it would corrupt your open .setlist file and save it

CON EXPLORER
- Added better compatibility for Dance Central 1, 2 and 3 files so the game IDs are not butchered and the files should now be able to be modified and keep their correct game IDs

SONG ANALYZER (NOW FILE ANALYZER)
- Renamed tool since it does a lot more analyzing of component files than just analyzing song files - no other change

CON CONVERTER (NOW CON/RBA CONVERTER)
- Renamed tool to make it clearer what it does since it also converts RBA/RBS files to CON format, as well as batch converting CON <-> LIVE

----------

v4.1.2

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Fixed bug where if the pack contained a duplicate song or there was an error dePACKing one song, it would fail to dePACK the remaining songs

SETLIST MANAGER
- Changed behavior so now RB4 can be selected as a source even when in RB3 mode - this is for RB4toRB3 conversions that have RB4 as a source in the DTA file

UPDATER
- Fixed ability to detect and receive updates that was broken when KeepItFishy server got a SSL certificate

----------

v4.1.1

VARIOUS TOOLS
- Fixed compatibility issue with Rock Band 1 songs / export pack that was caused by the DTA Parser and some unexpected behavior in those DTA files
- Fixed compatibility issue with songs that do not have a backing track at all, which was causing various tools to either crash or display incorrect information

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to export setlist to JSON format for use with websites and similar applications

----------

v4.1.0

GENERAL
- NAME CHANGE! For many years this tool suite has done more than work with CON files, so I'm dropping the CON from the name and just calling it C3 Tools going forward
- Few quality-of-life fixes that you probably won't notice but were necessary
- All links to www.customscreators.com now point to https://rhythmgamingworld.com/

VOLUME NORMALIZER (NEW FEATURE!)
- This Tool is intended to normalize the volume of a entire folder of CON/LIVE files by editing the DTA without modifying any audio
(Thanks to SuperRiderTH for the entire code for this Tool, I did nothing but integrate it)

FILE INDEXER
- Added ability to search for duplicate songs (by name)
- Added ability to double-click on a song to send to Visualizer
- Can now send to Visualizer back to back without audio errors
- Can now delete (sends to Recycle Bin) one or multiple files directly from the form
- Can now move one or multiple files from one folder to another, will automatically add the new folder to the list of folders to be indexed
- Now clicking on the folders on the top panel will narrow down the songs displayed on the bottom panel, can select one or multiple folders
- All "Send to" commands have keyboard shortcuts

VISUALIZER
- Fixed bug where RB4 to RB3 conversions would show double Multitrack icons
- Fixed bug where songs created with Onyx Music Game Toolkit would have keys/vocals and crowd/backing tracks swapped
- Fixed bug that would throw errors with some songs from the RB4toRB2 team due to leftover crowd_channels line in the DTA file
- Now properly identifies and processes The Beatles: Rock Band custom songs created by the TBRB CDLC team
- Added experimental support for Green Day: Rock Band customs (in the hopes that someone figures it out)
- Fixed bug where the song "Pearls; The Frailty of Matter" would not display the song name correctly

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where songs with names that ended in ellipsis (...) would fail to convert the audio
- Fixed bug where songs created with Onyx Music Game Toolkit would have keys/vocals and crowd/backing tracks swapped
- Fixed bug where songs from the RB4toRB2 team would sometimes have the backing track split into mono crowd and mono backing tracks
- Switched default behavior in Phase Shift Converter to default to song.ogg rather than guitar.ogg
- Added option to NOT write HOPO threshold to the .ini file - this was requested due to a Clone Hero bug - disabled by default for maximum compatibility

CON CREATOR
- Added ability to create The Beatles: Rock Band packages (inspired by the work done by FujiSkunk while I was gone)
- Changed behavior so Content Image and Package Image default to be the same, which makes more sense than prior behavior - can still force them to be different if you want
- Added experimental support for creating Green Day: Rock Band, LEGO Rock Band, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock packages
- Fixed bug where CON Creator would freeze if you added files to the root folder

CON EXPLORER
- Added support for The Beatles: Rock Band customs (inspired by the work done by FujiSkunk while I was gone)
- Added experimental support for reading Green Day: Rock Band, LEGO Rock Band, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock packages
- Added button on main form to make it obvious this feature exists since apparently many people were not aware of it
- Fixed bug where changing song ID would cause issues with some songs... should work as intended now

SONG ANALYZER
- Added ability to detect presence of Pro Bass and Pro Guitar charts in the MIDI file and do some basic analysis. This is very basic and experimental for now.

BATCH RENAMER
- Fixed bug where it would fail to process songs by T. Rex
- Fixed bug where the song "Pearls; The Frailty of Matter" would not rename correctly

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Fixed bug where songs created with Onyx Music Game Toolkit would have keys/vocals and crowd/backing tracks swapped
- Fixed bug where songs from the RB4toRB2 team would sometimes have the backing track split into mono crowd and mono backing tracks

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed behavior where Merge Songs option would be disabled when no existing DTA was present, now it creates a blank DTA and allows you to merge songs from the start

VIDEO PREPARER
- No longer leaves multiple definitions of mute_volume and mute_volume_vocals in the songs' DTA files (thanks FujiSkunk for the code)

----------

v4.0.0
MAIN
- Somewhat severe GUI redesign ... enjoy it. If you hate it, you can change most of it back by playing with the customization settings available

SONG ANALYZER
- Modified behavior for 'Batch analyze for unpitched vocals' so now it only identifies songs that are 75% or more unpitched vocals (should reduce false positives)
- Modified behavior for 'Batch analyze for unpitched vocals' so now it also separates songs that have no vocal charts into their own subfolder
- Improved interface during processing of 'Batch analyze for unpitched vocals' to remove flashing that happened before

EVENT MANAGER
- Added setting for Maximum Security and Relaxed Security under Options -> Lock Severity - Maximum Security will limit almost all interaction with the form when locked, Relaxed Security allows for adding, skipping, modifying queue, and similar functions
- Minor improvements and bug fixes

FILE INDEXER
- Modified behavior to fix bug where it would ignore CON files with periods in the file name (because Windows identifies anything after the period as a file extension and not part of the file name)

CON EXPLORER
- Modified behavior so now changing song ID also changes the song short name (first entry at top of DTA) to avoid file conflict issues - does NOT modify file path or CON structure, just the short name
- Modified behavior so now when changing song ID the old (presumably original song ID) is preserved in the DTA by commenting it out rather than removing it altogether - can be used to retrieve original ID if needed

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added step that should prevent rare control character errors created by XML setlist files with weird characters
- Fixed a few GUI bugs

VISUALIZER
- Fixed bug with image links not being parsed correctly due to change from http to https on Imgur's end

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Fixed bug with image links not being parsed correctly due to change from http to https on Imgur's end

----------

v3.9.8
EVENT MANAGER
- Added feature to select a random winner for the event (chosen from previous performances)
- Added feature to show estimated end time of event based on current queue (uses song length from Setlist file when available, estimates 4:00 per song when not available, and adds a 1:00 delay between songs to keep things realistic)
- Add Band field is now a combo box, which lets you click on a drop down to select from previous acts and also auto-suggests and auto-appends (press Enter) based on previous acts
- Can now double-click on a song in the queue to send it to Play Now
- Re-arranged fields when entering a new performance for more streamlined process
- Fixed bug that would cause soft crash when clicking to play after editing a song in the queue
- Other minor fixes throughout

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added option to use silent mode when drag/dropping CON or DTA files (under Options) so you don't get repeated prompts when drag/dropping multiple CONs or DTA files

SONG ANALYZER
- Added feature to batch analyze a folder of CON or MIDI files to identify songs that have unpitched (# or ^) vocals - find it under the Lyrics/Vocals tab - option to separate the files with unpitched vocals will move the CON/MIDI files to a folder named _UNPITCHED VOCALS in the same location - this looks at both PART VOCALS and HARM1/HARM2/HARM3 parts
- Fixed bug in analysis of songs that would not count unpitched vocals using ^ in Harmonies

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Ability to specify encoding quality (1-10, default 5) is back as requested - applies both when splitting stems (if not encrypted) and when downmixing to stereo (always possible)
- Fixed bug that would sometimes fail when downmixing mogg files to stereo ogg during conversion

FILE INDEXER
- Added feature to search for songs with song ID conflicts - find it under Tools

----------

v3.9.7
SETLIST MANAGER
- Make corrections to how items are sorted to match exactly (in theory) how they're sorted in game
- Added ability to search for songs with possible file path conflicts
- Added ability to search for songs with possible short name conflicts
- Added ability to search for songs with possible song ID conflicts
- Exporting to Excel or CSV using the 'Everything' option now includes the song's short name
- Added small label that shows you how many songs you have selected at any given point (was useful to me)

VIDEO PREPARER
- One of the restricted tools only available to C3 Authors before is now available to the public!

- Changed behavior so when exporting setlist using Detailed 1, Detailed 2 or Detailed 3 PDF formats while Sorted By Artist, each Artist's songs are sub-sorted alphabetically (same behavior as in Basic 1 and Basic 2) rather than the random entry order in the song cache
- Added option to only write the artist name once when exporting setlist using Detailed 1, Detailed 2 or Detailed 3 PDF formats while Sorted by Artist 
- Fixed bug that would tell you you had to unlock the program even when it was unlocked if you exited via File -> Exit

----------

v2.7.0
ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Given all the recently and newly added (see below) features, it's no longer appropriate to call it "Album Art Converter", so renamed it
- Added ability to extract textures from your Rock Band 3 save game file. Drag and drop the file to Advanced Art Converter. Bam. Instantly get your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- Added support for more texture types and expanded support to all Rock Band games and expansion packs, the Rock Band music store app, and all Dance Central games
- Added ability to copy the current folder to directory or paste a directory to search in. Just right-click on the folder text box at the top
- Added feature that will remember last directory used and default to it if it still exists next time you run the program
- Fixed bug that would cause all images to be shifted slightly to the right
- Greatly reduced and improved the code for higher efficiency and accuracy in the conversion process

SAVE FILE IMAGE VIEWER (NEW!)
- Found in Advanced Art Editor -> Advanced
- Allows you to view your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- All three consoles are supported - see HELP doc for more information
- You can export all images by going to File -> Export all images or by clicking on the respective image's Export image button
- Five backgrounds are included for your character. If you want to change them, replace "bg1.png", "bg2.png", "bg3.png", "bg4.png" or "bg5.png" in the /res folder. To export a composite image of your character on the selected background, right click and choose "Export composite image"
- The code for editing and replacing of images is there, but disabled since the game continues to say the file is corrupt. Hopefully someone else can pick up where I left off and finish it. For now, EDITING IS DISABLED. ONLY VIEWING/EXTRACTING IS ENABLED.

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added support for Rock Band Blitz song cache files ("Library Files") - Xbox 360 ONLY (not quite sure if PS3 has a cache for it)
- To import a Blitz cache, go to File -> Import RB Blitz song cache. You can also add "blitz" to the name of the cache file and then drag and drop it. If you try drag/drop without having "blitz" in the filename it will fail, since it will assume it's a RB3 cache file
- There are some limitations: Blitz does not keep track of a few fields that RB3 does, so we don't have gender (defaults to Male), master status (defaults to being a master), song length (will show as 0:00), rating (defaults to NR), track number (defaults to 1)
- Fixed a couple of potential bugs for more stability

PACK EXPLORER
- Fixed bug introduced when this tool was strictly for Rock Band use which would change the game ID of any CON file opened to Rock Band 3 by default if it wasn't another Rock Band title - now can open, edit and save CON/LIVE files from other games without affecting the game ID
- Made the Visualize button only show up when the program can find a songs.dta file in the CON, otherwise it's not a Rock Band song and can't be Visualized

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug that would create a corrupt VENUE track, which in turn would cause playability issues with some songs
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of the venue from RBN2 to RBN1 (enabled by default)
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of post processing events (enabled by default)

VISUALIZER
- One more bug fix for using our default font. It was requiring you had Myriad Pro default installed, not just the included Myriad Pro Bold. Fixed

GENERAL
- Fixed behavior throughout to avoid issues of files being in use when the program scans for CON files

----------

v2.6.1
PS3 CONVERTER
- Changed method used to make the EDAT files to a more reliable and efficient tool = less failures, more consistency, less clutter

VISUALIZER
- Added option to pick between Myriad Pro (default), Calibri, Tahoma and Times New Roman fonts
- Changed behavior when our default font is not installed or accessible = program will keep running and you can just choose a different font
- Simplified ability to use a custom font = create a text file named font.txt and place it in the /res folder. Enter one line of text that says FontName=Name Here and save it. Visualizer will load that and make it default, but you can still choose any of the other fonts mentioned above. Make sure the font name is spelled correctly (case sensitive) and is actually installed on your system.

- Added ability to make form background transparent. Combine it with borderless and hide the banner = free-floating buttons!

----------

v2.6.0
- Since it's been brought up so many times and the program no longer resembled Le Fluffie in any way, we've renamed to C3 CON Tools. 
MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR SHORTCUTS TO POINT TO C3CONTools.exe! That includes changing the path in Magma: C3 Roks Edition under ADVANCED SETTINGS.

PS3 CONVERTER (NEW!)
- Customs come to PS3! (Requires jailbroken PS3, see included Help Documentation)
- Allows you to very quickly batch convert CON/LIVE files into PS3 format
- Allows you to merge already-converted songs with your existing customs (i.e. files downloaded from C3's database)

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Increased in-game album art quality exponentially (about 8x the image data) - now creates 512x512 DXT5 textures instead of prior 256x256 DXT1 textures when converting to png_xbox or png_ps3 
--- As of this writing, Magma: C3 Roks Edition isn't updated to accept these files natively. Refer to the updated tutorial on the Magma: C3 Roks Edition thread on how to get these higher quality album art files into your song
- Increased quality of images converted from png_xbox/png_ps3 (also noticeable in Visualizer)
- Added support for most Rock Band game textures (besides the usual album art files) - can be converted from *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3 to *.png, *.bmp, *.jpg and/or *.dds. No guarantees are made that it will work with all game textures from all Rock Band games, but over 3,000 textures from RB3 and TB:RB have been tested and worked
- Added support for input images in Targa format (*.tga)
- Removed ability to resize images on the fly when converting from png_xbox/png_ps3/png_wii - this yielded lower quality than doing so afterwards on Paint.NET or Photoshop, and allows for otherwise overall better quality as mentioned above

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed bug caused by old songs having Track Number 0 that would cause the Information panel to stop showing song information
- Fixed bug where certain songs would have ridiculous rating numbers that would cause the program to crash
- Fixed bug where files would not refresh when drag/dropping one Setlist after having another Setlist already opened

MAIN FORM
- Re-designed the layout to account for all the latest additions
- Added ability to fully customize your experience = resize the form to your liking; make the form be borderless; right-click on the background to choose a custom background color or use a custom background image (or drag and drop the image to the form); right-click on any button to change the background color and the text color of the button; right-click on the C3 banner to make transparent or hide. All of these changes will be saved and will be there next time you run the program. If you want to share your customization, just share the main.config file found under the /bin folder. Your friend can replace his or just drag and drop it to the program
- Right-click on the background and select "Reset everything..." to put everything back to stock

----------

v2.5.1

- Improved how moving of files works throughout the program for better performance and lower likelihood of crashes
- Fixed bug when sending files/folders to Recycle Bin which sometimes would fail and leave the files/folders behind

----------

v2.4.4c

----------

v2.4.4b
QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Bug fixes that would lead to failures when dePACKing the AC/DC Export Pack, Green Day Export Pack and RHCP's Blood Sugar Sex Magik Album

----------

v2.4.4
QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added option to dePACK packs into individual songs with one click. Each CON file will retain the same game ID as the original pack (i.e. RB1/RB2/RB3) and will be named Artist - Song. By default the CON files will use the song's album art file as thumbnail, user can change this to use the pack's thumbnail image.

MIDI CLEANER
- Expanded ability to clean CON/LIVE files. Same behavior as before - drag/drop one or multiple CON/LIVE files or use the "Browse..." button to find them. Can only combine CON/LIVE files with MIDI files. LIVE files will be changed to CON and unlocked/made anonymous in the process. No packs or pro upgrades.
- Expanded fixing of uncapitalized words to HARM2 (off by default) - before would only check PART VOCALS/HARM1

GENERAL
- Further enhancements to the code for stability and to remove some redundancy throughout the entire program.

----------

v2.4.3
ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Added PS3 support! Can now convert to and from *.png_ps3 images
- Minor behavior changes to logging

MIDI CLEANER
- Fixed cleaning of incorrectly formatted lyrics, now it detects all instances and fixes them correctly
- Added check to existing BEAT track for back-to-back downbeats
- Modified code to ensure creation of BEAT track does not generate back-to-back downbeats
- Added check for 1/x time signatures ... since these are so rare, user will be notified as a warning of a possible mistake in the tempo map
- Expanded persistent options to include whether to override note velocities, the note velocity value, whether to correct notes that are too short, and what size to change them to

VISUALIZER
- Added support for PS3 (*.png_ps3) images for album art
- Changed behavior when reading the MIDI file to estimate if the file is Expert-Only. If the program determines it most likely is Expert-Only, you'll be shown why it thinks so and you can choose whether to mark is as Expert-Only or not. Songs marked as Expert-Only through Magma: C3 Roks Edition will continue to behave as they have in the past.
- Changed location of difficulty tier form to be centered on Visualizer's location rather than centered on the screen
- Fixed bug that would require pressing on Harmony image twice to change from one-part harmony to two-part harmony

GENERAL

GENERAL
- Improved code in all instances where CON/DTA files are imported/processed to expand compatibility with RB1 era files

----------

v2.4.1
MIDI CLEANER
- Added finding and moving of [music_start] event if it's earlier than two beats from the start of the track
- Added option (enabled by default) to create a BEAT track for the MIDI if one is not present already - this is highly accurate for most songs, but it may fail if there are irregularities in the MIDI file (i.e. very rare but possible, mostly very old files) - songs with 11/16 and similarly "weird" time signatures may need thinning of the BEAT track to match the "feel" of the song
- Added cleaning of lyrics with either # ^ & markers at the start of the lyric, now will be moved to the proper placement (as the last character of the lyric)
- Added option to display total number of issues fixed broken down by instruments (on by default when Detailed Logging is enabled)
- Greatly improved reporting accuracy when using [M:B:T] format during detailed logging (i.e. easier to find the problems in REAPER)
- Fixed code to ensure all tracks finish with an EndTrack event (just for a healthier MIDI file, no changes in behavior for RB3 purposes)
- Adjusted code so a "clean" copy isn't exported when nothing is actually cleaned in the MIDI
- Fixed bug that would not save clean MIDI to the right directory if MIDI Cleaner was opened via command-line or Magma
- Fixed bug that would sometimes report wrong notes twice when the MIDI was using running status
- Fixed bug that would report the uncapitalized lyrics without specifying the track name

WII CONVERTER
- Added code to convert unsupported RBN2 venues into supported RBN1 venues = working camera cuts and lighting calls! 
- This takes place automatically when converting an existing CON to Wii format, or you can click on 'Extras' -> 'Convert VENUE from RBN2 to RBN1' and you can process MIDI files for songs you've already converted. You can do one or multiple MIDI files at a time this way.

BATCH RENAMER
- Added option (enabled by default) to sort expert only songs separately when "Try detailed sub-sorting" is enabled. For songs created with Magma: C3 Roks Edition this is picked up from the DTA file. For other songs this is estimated based on the charts found in the MIDI file.

BATCH EXTRACTOR (previously DTA EXTRACTOR)
- Expanded from only extraction of DTA files to include MIDI, MOGG and MILO_XBOX files
- Can extract one or all of the file types above from one or multiple CON/LIVE files at once
- Still uses all the renaming features present before, each file type is grouped in its own folder
- For PNG_XBOX (album art) files, continue to use ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR

PACK CREATOR
- Several bug fixes and code changes to eliminate (or at least reduce) the "access to folder denied" errors reported that would cause the process to fail

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Added some code to improve loading of some MIDI files that may not have loaded before due to format errors

GENERAL
- Enabled running multiple instances of the program
- Enabled opening of MIDI Cleaner by drag-dropping a MIDI file to the main form

----------

v2.4.0
MIDI CLEANER (NEW!)
- Feature to batch process old RB/GH/FoF/PhaseShift MIDIs to get them as close to RBN 2.0 compliance as possible via automation.
- MIDI Cleaner will NOT make an old RB/GH/FoF/PhaseShift MIDI ready to compile in Magma, but it will reduce a lot of the time you have to spend cleaning it up.
- MIDI Cleaner can be opened via command-line two ways: use -cleaner as an argument to open MIDI Cleaner, or use the file path to a specific MIDI file to open it automatically. This also means you can do Right-Click -> Open With and select C3 CON Tools
- For the extensive list of features included refer to the Help in MIDI Cleaner

QUICK PACK EDITOR (NEW!)
- Finally one of the most requested features is here! This allows you to quickly modify a pack of songs in two ways:
You drag and drop or browse for a pack, the program reads it, shows you all the songs it finds. Select all the songs you want to remove, leaving the ones you want to keep in the new package. Don't worry, you have plenty of opportunity to change your mind. Then you choose
1) Edit DTA entries only - the songs will be removed from the songs.dta file, so in game they will no longer show up. This is much quicker but leaves you with the same file size pack
2) Edit DTA entries and pack contents (default) - will remove the songs from the songs.dta file as well the associated files in the package. This is the preferred method but takes considerably longer
- If you want to go a little further, you can also change the title and description text, the package and content thumbnails (what you see in this program and the Xbox dashboard), and the game ID in case you want to change it (default value is whatever game ID the input file had)

QUICK DTA EDITOR (NEW!)
- Feature to quickly open and edit the DTA file (controls all metadata in the song)
- Drag and drop a song/pack file, or use the 'Open file' menu option. The DTA file is automatically extracted and opened in Notepad, you make your changes, exit out and click Yes to save. The modified DTA file is replaced and the song/pack file is saved as a signed, unlocked CON file ready for your Xbox

VISUALIZER
- Added option to use custom overlays for holidays and other special moments. You need two files, one called "theme_overlay.png" and one called "theme_button.png" - replace "theme" with the name of your holiday or whatever you want. Place those two in the /res folder. Visualizer includes six preset themes: Christmas ("xmas"), Valentine's Day ("love"), St. Patrick's Day ("stpaddy"), Summer ("summer"), Independence Day ("freedom") and Halloween ("spooky"). When making your own, use the included themes as reference. Your files must match the dimensions of the included themes and be .png (with transparency). Then in Visualizer you or anyone you share the files with clicks on the lock and enters the name of your theme, and voila. If you named your files "valentines_overlay.png" and "valentines_button.png", the password would be "valentines" in Visualizer. C3 Authors must make sure to get admin approval if they're planning to use any custom designs.
- Fixed bug where expert only chart that was also marked as X-Only in Magma would show two X-Only icons
- Fixed annoying bug where every time you typed into the Name or Artist fields it would always scroll to the end

BATCH RENAMER
- Fixed bug where some special characters would end up in the file name, which the Xbox would not accept
 
PACK CREATOR
- Small code changes to hopefully eliminate the random crashes after building a pack using a thumbnail from one of the cons in the pack
- Fixed bug where input files would be counted incorrectly and lead to incorrect "duplicates" message

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Fixed bug that had broken ability to use pro upgrade con

WII CONVERTER
- Added option to replace non-working .milo_wii files with a working basic one from an official song. It is not a perfect solution but it gives you some sort of camera cuts and lighting effects, rather than a static camera. This option is only available when doing Smart Folder Merge. 

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Added option to replace the genre with the song's subgenre. Note that Phase Shift does NOT support subgenres, so this replaces the genre with subgenre in the song.ini file, not add both.

----------

v2.3.5
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to use TIFF (*.tif), GIF (*.gif) and DDS (*.dds) images for the album art
- Added Halloween and Christmas overlays if you want to theme your Visualizer images...these will only show up in the months of October and December respectively

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Added ability to open *.tif, *.gif and *.dds images when converting to Xbox/Wii format
- Added ability to convert .dds images to usable Windows format
- New method for creating png_xbox images will generate better looking album art with less artifacts than before

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Bug fix on the song.ini creation for the proper preview start time metadata
- Further fixes to the creation of the song folders where disallowed characters would fail the process

GENERAL
- No longer using Tao.DevIL.dll or ILUT.dll (you can safely remove them if you still have them, no longer included with the program files)
- Greatly improved image handling to avoid crashes and more efficient processing
- Testing different way to enlarge/shrink images, let me hear your opinion! Better? Worse? The same? (= better because cleaner code).

----------

v2.3.3
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to display song rating (FF = Family Friendly, SR = Supervision Recommended, M = Mature, NR = Not Rated)
- Enabled auto-loading of Author Logo at run-time. Name it "author.png" (224x33 pixels) and place it in the program directory. This image goes in the small rectangle at the bottom of the album art.
- Changed behavior to account for long album names to shorten and add ellipsis (...) rather than have the text go off-screen 
- Changed behavior to replace "feat." and "featuring" with the much shorter "ft." to save space and generate text at an easier to read size
- Greatly improved the SPLIT behavior for better splitting and text resizing after splitting
- Fixed bug that would allow Genre/Sub-Genre to be moved up even when there was existing Album Name text
- Fixed bug that would show both Rhythm on Keys / Rhythm on Bass icons when importing a song that was compiled with the Rhythm on Bass marker in Magma.
- Other minor improvements

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Bug fixes on the song.ini creation code
- Fixed bug that would fail conversion if the song title or artist name had colon (:) in the name (i.e. Ulrich Firelord: Breaker of Mountains)

PACK CREATOR
- Added two C3 thumbnails. Use them when creating packs of C3 customs!

GENERAL
- Cleaned up the installation folder of all .dll and .exe files
- Other minor fixes

----------

v2.3.1
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to estimate whether a song is Expert-Only based on the contents of the MIDI charts. This should be "pretty good" at determining whether there are "some" reductions, not whether the reductions are done to any standard. Still, tests show a 90%+ accuracy. If you want more details as to what is and isn't in the MIDIs, you might want to use the MIDI Tester feature that will be available in Magma: C3 Roks Edition v2 soon.

CON EXPLORER
- Fixed bug that would cause a crash when extracting a file via right-click menu. TIP: You can extract files by drag/dropping them to your desktop/folder!
- Fixed bug where if you replaced a file by drag/dropping it, the form would not reflect that changes had occurred

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Cleaned up how the song.ini file is created to remove unused fields and modify some fields from old FoFix format to current PS format - thanks to AkiraNomuraBCN for the help!
- Added C3 icon to each song archive and necessary line to the song.ini file. You'll need to copy the C3 icon to your icons folder. Thanks to AkiraNomuraBCN for the suggestion.

WII CONVERTER
- Code changes to the png_wii creation code to hopefully reduce the crashing that has been reported at this step

PACK CREATOR
- Changed some code to hopefully fix the crashes reported when building a pack using a thumbnail from one of the con files

----------

v2.3
PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER (NEW!)
- Quickly and accurately converts CON/LIVE files to Phase Shift format - all the features that Phase Shift supports that are present in the CON are preserved!
- Only step you have to do manually is separate the mogg into individual ogg files - program can automatically send the mogg to Audacity for you
- Program can automatically RAR each converted song if you want to share them - will automatically append _phaseshift to each RAR archive
- By default, C3's banner (banner.png in the program directory) is included with Phase Shift songs, change that with another image if you'd like your own banner
- By default, the loading phrase is set to "www.customscreators.com" - to change it create a text file, name it loading_phrase.txt and place it in the program directory, enter anything you want to show up as your loading phrase in there

PACK CREATOR
- Added Thumbnail Viewer feature - will display the Package Image thumbnails for all the files loaded prior to building the pack - up to the first 100 files loaded. Just drag the thumbnail you want to either the Package Image or Content Image boxes

ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR
- Added option to extract the Package and Content Image thumbnails

WII CONVERTER
- Changed RAR behavior to append _wii to each RAR archive
- Minor bug fixes for a smoother operation

VISUALIZER
- Can now drag/drop user logo right to user logo field without having to click to select
- Harmonix and Rock Band Network songs are automatically labeled as Multitrack

GENERAL
- Massive consolidation and cleaning up of the code into single NemoTools class = more efficient, easier to maintain and significantly less lines of code overall	
- All instances where there is image handling should now be more efficient and accurate
- All instances where the songs.dta file is being read (Album Art Extractor, Batch Renamer, Visualizer, etc) should now be consistently accurate	
- Added option to click and drag the main form around - if any other forms are open they will be moved along with the main form
- Improved the restore form feature - if you hide or minimize a form, click on any empty space on the main form to restore it
- Hopefully fixed all instances of the code where user could not delete a folder/file until closing the program down
- Added ability to open Wii Converter directly in the desired folder by passing the argument as -wii -folderpath - future update to Magma will use this

----------

v2.2.2
WII CONVERTER
- Added option to clear contents of folder before starting to avoid duplicates/file conflicts
- Fixed bug where preview start time would only show 1:0 instead of 1:00
- Fixed bug where song name was incorrectly determined for non Magma-created songs
- Fixed bug where if the process failed for one song it would stop the entire conversion process

GENERAL
- Added ability to export the log throughout the entire program, just right-click on the log box and select 'Export log file'

----------

v2.1
PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER (new!)
- allows for easy and quick bundling of songs with their pro upgrade - drag and drop the song, drag and drop the upgrade con or upgrade files, press Bundle...that's it! The songs.dta and upgrades.dta files are combined, the song's midi and the upgrade midi are combined, song is rebuilt as "filename_bundled". Your original files are not edited.
- Added -probundler argument: add it to your shortcut after the .exe: ...C3CONTools.exe" -probundler and the program will bypass the main screen and go straight to the Pro Upgrade Bundler

PACK CREATOR
Fixed several bugs pointed out by C16 (thanks!)...now it should work as intended:
- When using an existing folder structure, everything under "foldername/songs" and "foldername/songs_upgrades" are counted and added
- Better feedback to the user as to how many existing files are found

- Improved extracting by drag-and-dropping to desktop code...no more "extracting" inside of the program, better communication with the user and deleting of temporary files

----------

v2.0.0 RC2
VISUALIZER
- Added option to include user logo...must be PNG image up to 224x33 pixels (or smaller). Click on the clear rectangle (bottom of the album art) to select an image. Click on it again to drag your logo to where you want it. Right click and select "Clear logo" to remove the logo.

- Enable 'Rename files' if you want your files to be renamed (enabled by default) - can choose from four formatting options: "The Artist - Song", "Artist, The - Song", "Song - The Artist" or "Song - Artist, The" - renaming works by grabbing the artist and song from the songs.dta file for single songs (99%+ accurate?) - for pro upgrades and packs, it uses a bit of logic based on naming conventions and patterns (~90% accurate)
- If you want to replace blank spaces in your file name with underscores, select that option before clicking Begin ('Rename files' must be selected)
- Whether you're renaming or not, enable 'Try to sort files' to do basic top level sorting = sorting of the files based on established naming conventions - will sort to "pro_upgrades", "hmx_dlc", "c3_dlc", "rbn", "ghtorb3", "beatles" and "pony_rock"
- Enable "Try detailed sub-sorting" if you want to have sub-sorting into "rb1" and "rb2" subfolders (rb3 content stays in main sorted folder), and then finally "packs" or "albums"
- Will also find duplicates! - default behavior is to append (2)(3), etc - select 'Delete older copies' to delete files with older "last modified on" dates with the same internal file name (i.e. v3 of a song for which you have v4), select "Delete exact copies ONLY" to delete files with same name, file size and "last modified on" date (i.e. exact duplicates of a file) - duplicates are sent to your Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore your files if something went wrong

DTA EXTRACTOR (NEW!)
- Allows you to batch extract the songs.dta files from CON/LIVE files very quickly
- Provides several naming options so the files aren't all named "songs.dta" - 5 different naming options available
- Can remove spaces in file names or replace with underscores for post-processing with software that doesn't like spaces

ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR (NEW!)
- Allows you to batch extract the album art files (png_xbox) from CON/LIVE files
- Will extract from single songs as well as from packs!
- Provides several naming options so the files aren't all named the same - 5 different naming options available
- Can remove spaces in file names or replace with underscores for post-processing with software that doesn't like spaces
- After extracting, allows you to go straight into Album Art Converter to convert your files

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to mark a song as having 2x Bass Pedal icon (click on the drum icon to toggle)
- Added 'RB3 version' and 'Expert Only' icons to the Icon Panel
- Removed second 'Convert' icon and re-designed the Icons Panel
- Greatly improved how icons are enabled/disabled: double-click on any icon in the Icons Panel to send it down, or drag and drop it. In the template box, you can also drag and drop the icons from slot 1 to slot 2, and vice versa
- Added ability to read subgenre from song. Can only display genre OR subgenre, click on the the one you want to show
- Added ability to overwrite font size...will always auto-size first, then you can enlarge or shrink the Song Title, Artist Name and/or Song Duration
- Added ability to split Song Title or Artist Name into two lines - just type the whole thing, then click on "Split": Visualizer will try to split as close to the middle of the phrase as possible without splitting a word. Click on "Join" to go back from two lines to one line
- Added ability to move the Song Title and the Artist Name - just click on the arrows and move the mouse around. This works with both one-line and two-line names
- Added ability to change font color individually for each component of the image! Just click on the color bar next to the name of the field (i.e. next to Song Title)
- Added ability to lower/raise the Year - it will be aligned to the Album Name or the Genre (this is useful for longer album names that typically overlap the Year)
- Changed previous restriction so Song Duration can now show up to 7 characters (i.e. 1:23:45) since the new Magma allows us to go beyond an hour
- Changed and improved code that reads song duration from songs.dta to take into account 60 minute+ songs
- Changed and improved drag-and-drop code - can now drop an image anywhere on the form and it will be assigned to the album art, and can drag and drop a song (CON or LIVE) anywhere on the form, including on the previously-restricted album art box and it will be loaded and processed
- Greatly improved uploading code: if fails will ask if want to retry, and can handle user input
- Changed default uploading / saving behavior: default is now to just upload to Imgur without making a local copy, you can check off "Local" to also save to your hard drive, uncheck "Imgur" if you ONLY want to save a local copy and not upload it to Imgur automatically
- Changed uploading behavior: link is copied to clipboard automatically but browser won't open unless you click on the link
- Changed the tiering behavior to show pro guitar/bass/keys difficulties when present rather than their 5-lane counterparts
- Added ability to read new metadata saved by Magma: C3 Roks Edition (whether song is karaoke, multitrack, expert-only, etc)
- Added field to show you who the author of the song is (if they're using Magma: C3 Roks Edition)
- Visualizer will try to make an educated guess as to whether the song is official DLC from HMX, from RBN or one of the GHtoRB3 tracks
- Added ability to interpret the contents of the Song Title: if the Song Title contains (RB3 version) (Rhythm Version) or (2x Bass Pedal), it will automatically select the appropriate icon(s) and remove it from the Song Title for you for a cleaner image
- Added ability to save / load 'Visualizer Profile' = saves the colors and font sizes for each component, so you can set your color scheme, save it, and load it at any time. Once you load a profile, that will become the "default" values until you close Visualizer (hint: you can distribute a custom Visualizer Profile with your custom skins)
- Reworked the font loading process: if "font.otf" or "font.ttf" are found in the 'res' folder, it will default to that (hint: this can be used to distribute a custom font with your custom skins), if not, it will default to the included c3.otf font. If the chosen font is not already installed, Visualizer will open it for you and prompt you to install the font. The program will close, run it again after installing the font and you will be good to go...PLEASE NOTE that not all fonts will work well with Visualizer's auto-size feature and GDI+ graphics drawing method. If your font doesn't play nice, you can still use it but you must set the size manually
- Improved code that verifies the song is not a pack - Visualizer no longer needs to extract the pack to determine it has more than once song inside
- Added small graphic to let you know Visualizer is loading when drag-n-dropping a large CON file (takes a few seconds)
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

PACK CREATOR
- Changed encoding for the songs.dta files - they now are encoded using UTF8 encoding and the line "encoding 'latin1'" is replaced with "encoding 'utf8'" - this should resolve most of the non-standard character issues caused by previous Packager
- Improved the option to use an existing folder structure (i.e. previously extracted and prepared pack) - Click on 'Advaced' -> 'Use existing folder structure' - YOU MUST SELECT THE SONGS FOLDER (i.e. "songs\yoursong\" - select the songs folder)
- If you load the Packager, and there were previously extracted files, and you accidentally click "No" (so it deletes and starts from scratch), your folder is moved to the Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore it
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)

- Added ability to add new files to existing package either by drag and dropping the files into the bottom panel, or right click and choose 'Add file(s)'
- Added ability to replace file by drag and dropping over the existing file in the bottom panel (can only replace file with same filetype - i.e., .mid with .mid, etc)
- Removed "option" to add new folder since it was never coded to work
- File sizes now display in KB or MB, so it makes more sense than looking at size in bytes

- Changing game ID will automatically change Content Image to match
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields

CON CREATOR
- Added ability to drag and drop entire folders [on the left panel] ... files inside the folder are automatically added as well. If it's a song folder structure, the "gen" subfolder and those files will also be added...if "songs.dta" is present, it will also be added
- Added ability to drag and drop files [on the right panel]

- Major code improvements and clean-up
- Re-designed most of the form to break away form the old Le Fluffie "look" and only give you what you need for Rock Band purposes

GENERAL
- now accepts arguments! This means you can create shortcuts with one of the following arguments and it will bypass the main screen and go straight to that form, which saves you time if you only ever use the Visualizer, for example. Valid arguments are "-visualizer" "-artconverter" "-packcreator" "-renamer" "-artextractor" "-dtaextractor" and "-songpackager". Only one argument per shortcut. Add it to your shortcut after the .exe: ...C3CONTools.exe" -visualizer
- program can now be opened via command line with the file path to a CON/LIVE file as the argument - will open in Song Explorer (now used by Magma: C3 Roks Edition!)
- Re-envisioned the "look" of the program - new modular look that will allow for further expansion rather than the already crowded drop-down menu system
- Miscellanous code improvements

X360 LIBRARY
- No longer using x360.dll, but instead imported only the relevant parts of the source code, cleaned it up, and fixed some parts that had problems...this may mean further improvements down the line as I fix up the library.
